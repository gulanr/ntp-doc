## Contributors to the Test Facility
The following individuals have all helped build the facility.
### [Dr. John Horack](https://engineering.osu.edu/people/horack.1)
*Senior Associate Dean, College of Engineering*

John M. Horack, Ph.D., is the inaugural holder of the Neil Armstrong Chair in Aerospace Policy at The Ohio State University, with tenured, full-professor appointments in the College of Engineering’s Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering department and the John Glenn College of Public Affairs. John is the faculty member overseeing the NTPEx facility and advisor to many of its users.

### [Noah Gula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahgula/)
*M.S. Aerospace Engineering 2020 - 2022*

Noah Gula, B.S.A.A.E, is a graduate student writing a thesis on utilizing real-time simulations to optimize propellant consumption during the cooldown phase of nuclear thermal propulsion engine operations. Noah initially designed and built the test stand to support his research.

### Other contributors
