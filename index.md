Welcome to the OSU NTP Experiments Knowledge Base

This website contains documentation, calculations, and analysis used to develop the OSU NTP Experiments (NTPEx) test stand and experimental activities.

## Overview
The NTPEx test facility is located in Scott Lab W092. It is a modular and configurable test stand which enables a variety of testing activities in NTP. It was designed in fall 2020 and has since been upgraded and used by several teams and investigators. More history is available [here](administration/history.md). The test facility is overseen by [Dr. John Horack](https://engineering.osu.edu/people/horack.1) and managed by [Noah Gula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahgula/).

## Usage
- For an overview of the design of the test stand, go to [Test Facility Design](design/design.md)
- To design hardware for the test stand, go to [Test Facility Hardware](design/hardware/hardware.md)
- To learn how to use the test stand software, go to [Test Facility Software](design/software/software.md)

## Using the Facility
If you are interested in using the facility, contact [Dr. John Horack](mailto:gula.8@osu.edu) and [Noah Gula](mailto:gula.8@osu.edu).
