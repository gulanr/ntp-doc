# Welcome to the OSU NTP Experiments Knowledge Base
This website contains documentation, calculations, and analysis used to develop the OSU NTP Experiments (NTPEx) test stand and experimental activities.

## Overview
The NTPEx test facility is located in Scott Lab W092. It is a modular and configurable test stand which enables a variety of testing activities in NTP. It was designed in fall 2020 and has since been upgraded and used by several teams and investigators. More history is available [here](administration/history.md). The test facility is overseen by [Dr. John Horack](https://engineering.osu.edu/people/horack.1) and managed by [Noah Gula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/noahgula/).
